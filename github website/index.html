	 		Kosova is an abstract strategy game that requires you to think ahead and force your opponents to make mistakes. It is a game made with the intent to create a board game experience that is similar to an RTS genre in video games. Personally for me, one of the best feelings when playing games is hitting that super lucky roll or drawing the exact card you need of the top of the deck. Unfortunately the worst feeling in games is losing to randomness and the bad feeling of losing the game to something that isn\'t in your control. Kosova's turn system is created with the intention to replicate the feeling of that joy and excitement of making the right choice. The turn system is also design to work in a way so that you do not getting the unwanted feeling that you lost because of randomness but because your opponent outsmarted you. You may have lost this game but you know that you will improve each time and next time you might even beat your opponent.

	 		<h2>How do you win?</h2>
	 		<p>A player will defeat the other player when they have killed all but two of the opposing players pieces.<p>

	 		<h2>Setting the game up</h2>
	 		<p>The game board is a 4 x 4 grid of squares and all pieces will be placed on the intersection of the grid lines. Each player starts with one jack, one queen, one king and one ace piece. Each player's Ace, King and Jack piece should be orientated <em>upright </em> and the Queen should be orientated <em> sideways</em>.</p>

	 		<h3>For reference the board should look like this:</h3>

	 		<ol>
	 			<li>The first letter represents the piece type</li>
	 			<li>The second letter represents the piece color</li>
	 			<li>The third letter represents the piece's orientation
	 				<ul>
	 					<li> S: Sideways </li>
	 					<li> U: Upright</li>
	 				</ul>
	 			</li>
	 			<li>*Note* Each [ ] represents an intersection on the grid not a square</li>
	 		</ol>

	 		<h2>Who can kill who?</h2>
	 		<ul>
	 			<li>Ace can kill the King, Queen</li> 
	 			<li>King can kill the Queen, Jack</li>
	 			<li>Queen can kill the Jack</li>
	 			<li>Jack can kill the Ace</li>
