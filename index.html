          <h2>Image Processing</h2>
          <p>
	  Throughout the spring term of 2020 I took Computational Linear Algebra,
	  CS 475/675. In this course we used various forms of image
	  processing as a way to apply the concepts we had learned.
	  These applications including low-rank approximations of images,
	  image denoising and image segmentation among others. Linked below
	  are implementations of the applications listed above.

          <h2>Cellular Systems</h2>
          <p>
	  During my studies in the winter term of 2020 I took Computational 
	  Modelling of Cellular Systems, BIOL 382. BIOL 382 presented many
	  tools used to investigate differential equation-based models.
	  Throughout the term we described many cellular processes.
	  Alongside one of my peers, we researched into CAR T-Cells.

	  to Dr. Brian Ingalls.

          <h2>Predictive Analytics Report</h2>
       	  <p>
	  As part of a course requirement for Communications in Mathematics &
	  Computer Science, ENGL 119, we were required to submit a whitepaper
	  on a topic in Mathematics. Myself and two of my
	  peers researched into the timeline and effects of Predictive Analytics.

	  Dr. Mark Spielmacher.
